# CycloneDX BOM

This is a so-called **meta-package**, it does not ship any own functionality, but it is a collection of optional dependencies.
This package's dependencies are tools* with one purpose in common:  
generate _[CycloneDX][link_website]_ Software-Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) from _node_-based projects.

| ecosystem | actual tool |
|:---------:|:------------|
| _npm_ | [@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm) |
| _pnpm_ | To be announced, suggestions welcome. <br/> Candidate: [cyclonedx-node-pnpm](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-pnpm) |
| _yarn_ | [@cyclonedx/yarn-plugin-cyclonedx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40cyclonedx/yarn-plugin-cyclonedx) |

*) You should not depend on this very meta-package, instead depend on the actual tool that fits your specific (eco)system.

## Out of Scope

There are systems, that are not node-targeting, but use node as a runtime/compiler environment, or use node package registry as a distribution system.
These systems are out of scope. Therefore, the following tools are not part of this very meta-package.

| system | actual tool(s) |
|:------:|:---------------|
| _Angular_ | [@cyclonedx/webpack-plugin with _Angular_](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40cyclonedx/webpack-plugin?activeTab=readme#user-content-use-with-angular) |
| _Bower_ | None. (_Bower_ is [deprecated](https://bower.io/blog/2017/how-to-migrate-away-from-bower/)!) |
| _esbuild_ | To be announced, suggestions welcome. <br/> Candidate: [cyclonedx-esbuild-plugin](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-esbuild-plugin) |
| _Parcel_ | To be announced, suggestions welcome |
| _React_ | [@cyclonedx/webpack-plugin with _React_](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40cyclonedx/webpack-plugin?activeTab=readme#user-content-use-with-react) |
| _Rollup_ | [rollup-plugin-sbom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-sbom?activeTab=readme) |
| _Rspack_/_Rsbuild_ | To be announced, suggestions welcome |
| _Svelte_ | To be announced, suggestions welcome |
| _Vite_ | [rollup-plugin-sbom with _Vite_](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-sbom?activeTab=readme#usage-with-vite) |
| _webpack_ | [@cyclonedx/webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40cyclonedx/webpack-plugin) |

Since version 4.0, this was all split to individual projects, and this project changed to a bare meta-package.
