# CycloneDX BOM

This is a so-called **meta-package**, it does not ship any own functionality, but it is a collection of optional dependencies.
This package's dependencies are tools with one purpose in common:  
generate _[CycloneDX][link_website]_ Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) from _node_-based projects.

| ecosystem | actual tool |
|:---------:|:------------|
| _npm_     | [@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm) |
| _yarn_    | to be announced <!-- maybe https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-yarn --> |
| _pnpm_    | to be announced <!-- maybe https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-pnpm --> |

You should not depend on this very meta-package, instead depend on the actual tool that suites your specific ecosystem.

## Out of Scope

There are ecosystems, that are not node-based, but use node as a runtime/compiler environment.  
These ecosystems are out of scope. Therefore, the following packages are not part of this very meta-package.

| ecosystem | actual tool |
|:---------:|:------------|
| _webpack_ | [@cyclonedx/webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cyclonedx/webpack-plugin) |
| _Angular_ | [@cyclonedx/webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cyclonedx/webpack-plugin) |
| _React_   | [@cyclonedx/webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cyclonedx/webpack-plugin) |
| _Parcel_  | to be announced |

## Library

If you are looking for a JavaScript/TypeScript library for working with CycloneDX, its data models or serialization,
then you might want to try [@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library).

## Previous versions

This project used to be a tool-set and a library to work and generate [CycloneDX][link_website] Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) from _npm_ and _yarn_ based projects.  
Since version 4.0, this was all split to individual projects, and this project changed to a bare meta-package.
