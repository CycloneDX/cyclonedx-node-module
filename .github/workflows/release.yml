# This workflow is used for publishing the Node.js package.
#
# Releases are triggered manually. This can be done by browsing to
# https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-module/actions?query=workflow%3ARelease
# and selecting "Run workflow". If releasing a patch for a previous version
# make sure the correct branch is selected. It will default to the default
# branch.
#
# You will also need to specify the version level increment for this release.
#
# Supported levels are major, minor and patch. Semantic versioning should be
# followed. i.e. major if the release includes breaking changes, minor for
# non-breaking changes with additional functionality and patch for bug fixes and
# dependency updates.
#
# You will also need to specify a value for the related commit message.
