## 4.0.0 - unreleased

This became a so-called **meta-package**, it does not ship any own functionality, but it is a collection of dependencies. (via [#321])

This package's dependencies are tools with one purpose:
generate _CycloneDX_ Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) from _node_-based projects.

* for    _npm_-based projects: [`@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm)
* for   _yarn_-based projects: to be announced
* for   _pnpm_-based projects: to be announced
* for _parcel_-based projects: to be announced

ðŸ’¡ You should not depend on this very package, but the actual tool that suites your specific ecosystem.

ðŸ’¡ If you are looking for a JavaScript/TypeScript library for working with CycloneDX, its data models or serialization,
then you might want to try [`@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library).

## 3.8.0 - 2022-04-24

* Added

## 3.4.0 - 2022-02-02

## 3.3.1 - 2021-12-11

* Fixed
  * Brought deprecated file `bin/cyclonedx-bom` back. (via [#224])  
    File is now a compatibility-layer that spits a warning.

[#224]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-module/pull/224

## 3.3.0 - 2021-12-10

* Changed
  * Renamed `bin/cyclonedx-bom` to `bin/make-bom.js` (via [#216])  
    This is considered a none-breaking change,
    as the CLI use of `npx cyclonedx-node`/`npx cyclonedx-bom`
    is untouched.
  * Errors are no longer thrown as `String`, but inherited `Error`. (via [#217])  
    This is considered a none-breaking change,
    as `Error.toString()` returns the original error message.
* Fixed
  * `ExternalReference.type` setter sets value correctly now. (via [#217])  
    Setter caused an Error or set to `undefined` in the past.
  * `AttachmentText` sets `encoding` correctly via setter and constructor now. (via [#217])  
    Set to `undefined` in the past.

[#216]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-module/pull/216
[#217]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-module/pull/217

## 3.2.0 - 2021-12-07

* Added
  * CLI endpoint `cyclonedx-node` is now available. ([#193] via [#197])  
    Already existing `cyclonedx-bom` stayed as is.
* Fixed
  * CLI no fails longer silently in case of errors. ([#168] via [#210])  
    Instead the exit code is non-zero and a proper error message is displayed.
